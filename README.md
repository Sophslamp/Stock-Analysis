# Stock-Analysis
This project is a Python program that analyzes historical stock data and predicts future prices using machine learning techniques like regression and time-series forecasting. The program performs the following steps:

Collects historical stock data from a reliable source
Cleans and prepares the data for analysis
Creates new features from the existing data that may help improve the accuracy of the model
Selects a machine learning model that best fits the data and business problem
Trains the model on the historical data
Evaluates the performance of the model on testing data
Uses the trained model to predict future stock prices
